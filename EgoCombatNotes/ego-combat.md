>[!important] Ancient Knowledge
> Ever since Kant, philosophy is ***cooked***. Basically, Plato and Aristotle figured out all of philosophy in the Stone Age. Reject all new philosophy and return to Rome!

## An Introduction into EGO Combat
>[!info] You can't make the communist omelet without Gulag'ing 100 million eggs.

- **Ego (noun)**: a person's sense of self-esteem or self-importance.  
    - For the sake of simplicity, assume I know nothing about Freud.  
    - Ego is internal, and not related to projections of confidence that individuals engage in to signal to others.
 
### EGO BASICS
>[!tldr] BASE ASSUMPTIONS
> Not born into country currently economically developing and/or at war.

--- 

>[!success] EGO
>Base stat. Used to determine HP and modify damage on GUT and FUN attacks.
>Determined by:
> - Early game:
>     - 2+ legal guardians (+2 EGO);
>     - 1 legal guardian (0 to +1 EGO);
>     - no consistent legal guardians (-1 EGO);
>         - divorced guardians are a 1D4 roll
>     - below poverty level (-2 EGO);
>     - middle income (0 EGO);
>     - high income (+1 EGO);
> - Siblings (within 3-4 years of your age):
>     - only child (EGO -1);
>     - 1-2 siblings (EGO 0 to -1);
>     - 3+ siblings (-1 EGO, additional -1 EGO for each sibling over 4)
> - Major life events (age 0-12):
>     - disability, minor (-1 EGO);
>     - disability, major (-2 EGO);

>[!danger] EGO HP
>Your internal social battery. Your belief in your ideas.

>[!hint] Aura Shield
> The boost you gain from the perception others have of you or your words.
>>[!info] Highly influenced by environment, highly dynamic. Your Aura Shield generates relative to several factors, including if your AURA base stat is higher or lower than your interlocutor's.

## ATTACK TYPES

>[!faq] What the fuck do you mean he resisted my QNTing?  

---

>[!example] PSY
>Psychological Acuity - think sales tactics and psychic war level 2 but also think of times you've used your empathy or own experiences to relate to others and make them more favorable to your words. Treating people with common courtesy and doing the correct signaling for people who expect it.
>>[!important] Only accept essential psychic cookies.

>[!info] QNT
>Exposition of facts, sources, data. Quant attack users benefit from experience in a specialized field or schooling and regular application of facts.
>>[!note] If you have good recall memory, you can use QNT attacks, but beware of their diminishing returns and over reliance. 

>[!danger] GUT
>Intuition, saying shit assertively without needing to elaborate. Chadface. No desire to convince the others. They should wonder why you believe in yourself so much, and if they don't, it's a skill issue.

>[!hint] FUN
>Use whimsy to break tension or even make jokes at your own expense. Cultural signaling, not intended to deceive. Memetics. Crashing out.

### COMBINATIONS

- Damage types can be combined into ***attacks***, these attacks can be planned out as a multi hit combo in advance for damagemaxxing.
- **GUT** and **PSY** are both intended to have damage modifiers based off if an aura shield is up or not.
    >[!important] **GUT** does minimal damage to aura shields but does 2x damage to bare **EGO**

- **QNT** damage is based off relative aura shield.
